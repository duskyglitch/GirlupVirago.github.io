                        Women with endometriosis are frequently misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), crohn’s or ulcerative for some time before a correct diagnosis is made. Visceral hypersensitivity is a key feature in both conditions.

                        A connection between dietary factors and endometriosis onset has become a topic of interest mostly due to the observation that physiological and pathological processes of the disease can be influenced by diet.

                        Endometriosis is a hormone-dependent, chronic inflammatory gynaecological condition that causes pelvic pain symptoms impacting on the physical, mental and social wellbeing of reproductive-age women (Bianconi et al., 2007). Despite the high prevalence, which has been estimated to be between 6–10% (Parazzini et al., 1994) and the recognized economic burden associated with the disease (Simoens et al., 2012), its aetiology remains elusive. Various pathogenetic factors – menstrual, genetic, environmental, lifestyle – have been claimed to be implicated in the disease establishment and development (Viganò et al., 2004, Viganò et al.,2012).

                        The pathogenesis of endometriosis is repeated tissue injury and repair which leads to it’s hallmark features of neoangiogenesis and neoneurogensesis (new blood vessels and new nerve fibres ). The latter leads to hypersesnitization of the gastrointestinal nerves which manifest as an exaggerated response to a mild inflammatory stimulus. While a spicy bowel of curry might cause a little bit of indigestion in someone without endometriosis , it can render someone with endometriosis with severe pain and bloating because of the exaggerated response.

                        Endo belly is a term used to describe the uncomfortable, often painful, swelling and bloating that’s associated with endometriosis. Women complain of looking almost 20 weeks pregnant because of the painful abdominal distension, along with other symptoms like nausea, constipation or diarrhoea.

                      Hormonal pills or pain killers or antacids can reduce endometriosis symptoms and act as a temporary band-aid. Gut health is very important when it comes to endometriosis and is a synonym of mental and physical well-being including mood, sleep, cognition, pain etc., Although endometriosis is most likely  an embryonically originated disease, it’s severity may progress with poor lifestyle and diet. Although data is limited there are many with endometriosis who found their symptoms to better with a properly “tailored” diet and some form of physical exercise.

                        Endometriosis is an estrogen dependent disease causing the levels of progesterone – the pregnancy hormone (required to make you fell calm, sleep better and successfully reproduce) to diminish. Hormones are these wonderful chemicals that keep every part of the body’s physiology in check. They regulate sleep, pain, hunger, reproduction, cognition, pH balance, blood sugar levels, heart rate, body temperature, growth of hair and nails, etc. and when their delicately balanced ecosystem is thrown out of balance, bad things happen!

                        The keto diet works by severely restricting carbs and inducing a state of ketosis so that the body burns fat for energy. An ideal keto plate consists of 75% of calories coming from fatty foods like avocados, fish, eggs, ghee, nuts, spinach, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, mushroom, coconut oil, dairy etc., 20% of calories coming from protein from pulses, greens and less than 5% of calories coming from carbs in the form of onions, whole fruits. The reason why keto diet is so famous is that, it has proven scientifically to reduce body fat, LDL cholesterol, insulin resistance, estrogen levels and overall metabolism including sleep and excretion. Now, this is very important, the fact that there is reduction in the level of insulin and estrogen has made this diet really good for those with endometriosis. Regulated amounts of insulin and estrogen means a reduction of PMS like symptoms namely cravings, cramps, breast tenderness, mood swings, irritability etc. all of which contribute to better quality of life and wellness. But, whether or not this diet works for everyone without long- term side effects is still a question left unanswered.

                        The IF diet is trending these days with those wanting to cut weight quickly. IF has several protocols like 14 hours to 16 hours a day or fasting for 2 days in a week or alternate day fasting. Claims of better quality of sleep after IF , increased energy throughout the day, better mood and cognition among others have been made, but the actual science of IF varies. People do generally fast when injured or sick, so that they can channel energy to repair cells or to fuel stem cells to heal and to make new cells. Since some people maybe sensitive to fasting or calorie deprivation, it is clinically advised to not stay more than 13 hours without eating anything.

                        In endometriosis, it is best to work with a nutritionist and self identification of foods that trigger inflammation. There is newer ongoing research into the gut “microbiome” and gut health which should yield promising insights in the days to come.
