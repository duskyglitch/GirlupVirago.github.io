                        Blemishes, bumps, pimples, breakouts—there are plenty of words we can use to talk about acne. Because there are so many types of acne and several treatment options, knowing the differences can be tough. Let’s learn about the 6 different types of acne, how they form, what they look like, and what you can do to treat them.





                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first 2 types of acne we’ll discuss—whiteheads and blackheads—are both non-inflammatory. This type of acne is usually easier to treat than inflammatory acne, so over-the-counter (OTC) treatments may work. The last 4 types—papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts—are types of inflammatory acne that can be harder to treat.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1) Whiteheads
                      In almost all cases, acne happens because the pores in your skin are clogged. Clogged pores can happen when there is too much oil, bacteria, or skin cell production, or as a result of hormonal changes. 

                       Whiteheads, also known as closed comedones, happen when pores are clogged all the way through. The length of the pore and the head of the pore are closed, creating a little white bump on top of the skin. It’s important to note that whiteheads can’t be removed or fixed by squeezing them, so don’t try to pop them on your own. Otherwise you may end up with scarring.

                       Over-the-counter (OTC) whitehead treatments include sulfur, salicylic acid, or benzoyl peroxide. These topical treatments can be applied to the whitehead itself or as an entire facial treatment. They help remove dead skin cells and excess oil, with benzoyl peroxide being the most effective option and sulfur being the mildest on your skin. Salicylic acid may help prevent non-inflammatory acne from returning in the future.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2) Blackheads
                       Unlike whiteheads, blackheads look black on the skin’s surface. They are known as open comedones because the head of the pore remains open, while the rest of the pore is clogged. Blackheads can be removed by squeezing, although that’s not recommended because it can cause scarring. 

                      Treatment options for blackheads are the same as treatments for whiteheads. Try to avoid using pore strips to pull out blackheads. Pore strips are an abrasive, temporary fix that can damage the top layer of your skin, making acne worse.

                        3) Papules
                      Papules are small red bumps that form when oil or excess skin cells block a pore and mix with bacteria on your skin called Cutibacterium acnes or C. acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes). The contents of this blocked pore spill out, which allows the bacteria to escape into the surrounding skin tissue. The bacteria then create an inflamed lesion. Papules do not contain pus.



                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4) Pustules
                        Pustules are small, bulging bumps with a white center and red, inflamed skin surrounding them. They are usually found in clusters on the chest, face, or back. Pustules form when a blocked pore gets infected, but they can also be caused by hormonal changes in the body. They are similar to papules, except pustules contain yellowish fluid known as pus. 

                      Popping pustules may cause the bacteria to spread, so don’t try to pop or squeeze them. Only your doctor can safely drain pustules.

                     The same OTC and prescription treatment options used for papules apply to pustules. Antibiotics are almost always recommended in order to get rid of the bacteria-filled pus.
