                        My period warning signs include flashes of red hot anger when my family gets too noisy in the mornings, tears threatening to spill out while watching a not-so-emotional movie and most importantly, a strong urge to throw things against the wall at the slightest inconvenience. The symptoms are not pleasant – not for me and definitely not for the ones around me, but I’m grateful for them because that’s when I know to start preparing myself for the onslaught of blood, cramps and discomfort that would probably hit in a few days.

                       When my periods first started when I was in the 8th grade, I embraced the rage that came along, thinking I was justified to be raging uncontrollably. Once I went to college, I realised my outbursts were not cool at all and started warning my friends about possible hormonal outbursts in the following week. I was not afraid to walk away from conversations if I felt my emotions getting the better of me but I could not avoid the emotional toll at the end of the day. Finally, when the pandemic started, I had a chance to re-examine my emotions during my periods. I realised that they are over-thetop, mostly irrational, dark, self-hating and sometimes come out in the worst possible ways. These dark thoughts have become more accentuated lately, though this might be a consequence of the general bad mental health I have been experiencing for the past 7 months.

                       Nonetheless, I decided I needed to figure out a way around it.

                        The pain bears on it the mark of growth. Unfortunately that pain is used both to belittle the people who feel it, as well as to snatch away the autonomy they have over their own bodies. There are people who are quick to revere reproductive ability, while expertly separating it from the people who bear them, and use it as a righteous reason to deprive them of rights that are essential to their quality of life, and position in society. Scotland recently became the first country to make menstrual products free of cost, and it was celebrated as a step in the right direction, as it certainly is. But the fact that others are slow to follow Scotland’s example is as frustrating as it is disheartening, especially when one considers the number of people who face dire hygienic conditions because their governments won’t take the same first step.

                         Nevertheless, the fact that the step has been taken by the few, stands for something. It says that the people who are no longer inhibited from talking about their own bodies, in order to create a healthier socio-cultural atmosphere, are getting to where they want to be. The blood we bleed is being recognized as the covenant it has always been, only louder. Women born in bodies that don’t have periods are making artificial blood because they recognize it as an experience to cherish. People who don’t bleed as regularly as others breathe a sigh of relief when they do, because their bodies are in tune with the moon again.

                        The reclaiming of the narrative of our bodies is underway, on behalf of every paranoid thought, and whisper, and for all those who pioneered and innovated for this reality. Why be silent about something so loud as red?

                          Culture is as man-made as anything made of concrete. However, unlike concrete, it remains fluid. It molds to the heat of our hands, and submits to the force of our wills. We are building a culture where people aren’t made to hide themselves, or exclude themselves from their families because of a bodily function, and acceptance is not a matter of convenience.

                         “Sky is womb, and she’s the moon,” a lyric by Bon Iver, is a requiem to all that harbors life. How incredible it is that our bodies ebb and flow like tides and waves to the gravity of the moon.
