A woman's existence endures. Her body, which bears the brunt, should be her peaceful space.

'A WEBSITE FOR GIRLUP VIRAGO'

GirlUp Virago is an initiative that I started during the pandemic to create awareness about female and hygiene and women empowerment.

The website contains information regarding various health issues faced by women, in the form of blogs/articles. The blogs/articles are available in multiple languages(English and Hindi) for the reader's convenience. The website also has a chat window facility for a one-on-one consultation with the health experts we have on board, which will help them get a better understanding of the health issues they are facing, along with some information about the precautionary measures they must take to avoid the situations from going worse.

For implementation, I have used HTML, CSS, JS(front-end development), MySQL Database(Database) and PHP, Ajax, Jquery(Chat Window).
